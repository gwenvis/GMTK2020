  message: "From: your_wife_michelle@email.com\r\n\r\nHello Anton,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
    sorry it has come to this, but you leave me no other choice. You\u2019re lazing
    around all the time, not earning any money. The least you could do is help around
    the household! This message marks the last time you\u2019ll hear from me.\r\n\r\nI
    really urge you to find a job or a hobby. At least do something, rid yourself
    of this loser lifestyle. I wish you the best of luck, you can do it.\r\n\r\nTake
    care,\r\nMichelle Schouten.\r\n"
